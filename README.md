# CardGamesCSharp
This project is an extendable platform to create card games in the console. I've programmed all of this project in C# and I plan on adding new card games to this project in the future. Some other future ideas for extensibility that I am thinking about are: creating a website, or a desktop app with a GUI. Right now, this program only has Blackjack implemented. The code for Blackjack is fully documented using Doxygen [a link](https://github.com/AdamKvant/CardGamesCSharp/tree/main/CardGamesCSharp/docs)
